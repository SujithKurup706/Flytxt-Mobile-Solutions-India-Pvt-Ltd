# Critical Server Disk Space Issue

Problem: A production server reached 95% disk utilization, risking system-wide failure.

Solution:

- Utilized 'du' and 'find' commands to identify large and unnecessary files
- Implemented a log rotation policy using 'logrotate' to manage log file sizes
- Created a cron job to automatically clean up temporary files older than 7 days
- Expanded disk space by 50% and implemented Nagios alerts for proactive monitoring

Result: Reduced disk usage to 60%, preventing potential downtime and improving system stability.

### Complex Campaign Failure for Major Telecom Client

Problem: A high-priority campaign for Airtel failed to execute, potentially impacting millions of customers.

Solution:

- Analyzed CDR files using custom grep and awk scripts to identify data inconsistencies
- Collaborated with the client to correct input data format issues
- Optimized campaign parameters in the Neon platform to handle the corrected data
- Executed a series of test runs to ensure campaign stability
- Implemented additional data validation checks to prevent similar issues

Result: Successfully re-ran the campaign within 4 hours, reaching 98% of the intended audience and maintaining client relationship.

### Database Performance Degradation

Problem: Slow query response times causing delays in real-time campaign execution.

Solution:

- Utilized SQL Server Profiler to identify problematic queries
- Collaborated with the database team to optimize query structures and implement indexing strategies
- Implemented query caching for frequently accessed data
- Adjusted database maintenance schedules to minimize impact on peak campaign hours

Result: Improved overall query performance by 40%, reducing campaign execution time from 30 minutes to 18 minutes on average.

## Continuous Improvement Initiatives

- Spearheaded the implementation of a knowledge base system, reducing recurring tickets by 30%
- Initiated weekly team knowledge sharing sessions, improving overall team efficiency by 20%
- Proposed and implemented a customer feedback loop, leading to the development of three new platform features
